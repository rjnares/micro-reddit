# Micro-Reddit

This is my implementation of the [Micro-Reddit](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-micro-reddit) project assigned in the [Active Record Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails#active-record-basics) section of the [Ruby on Rails Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails) which is part of the [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails) curriculum from the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Skills Applied

* Creating Active Record Models
* Creating, updating, and running Active Record Migrations
